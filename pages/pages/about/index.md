I'm a serial entrepreneur and this is my personal blog. I've done a variety of things over the years but the short version is that I was a Dean at Harvard for five, went back to business school, [started a company with my significant other](https://www.tuckerman.co/), run a [small digital strategy company](http://www.quarterdeckdesign.com/), and help out with the [family fly-fishing business](http://www.spinozarods.com/). When I'm not working I enjoy running, the outdoors, and watching the Red Sox and Patriots.

What else? I love working with and advising entrepreneurs, and learning new software tools and frameworks. I'm a bit of a productivity nerd, and get a kick out of finding better ways to do things. I love supporting non-profits and social ventures that are trying to make the world a better place.
